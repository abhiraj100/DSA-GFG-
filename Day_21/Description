Class Definition:
Defines a class named GfG.

Method Signature:
Declares a public static method named palinArray.
Takes two parameters: an array of integers (a) and the number of elements in the array (n).

For-each Loop:
Initiates a for-each loop to iterate through each element (num) in the array a.

Variable Declarations:
Declares three variables: original to store the original number, reversed to store the reversed number, and remainder to store the remainder in each iteration of the while loop.

While Loop for Reversing:
Initiates a while loop to reverse the number.
In each iteration, it calculates the remainder when dividing num by 10, adds the remainder to the reversed number (reversed), and removes the last digit from num.
This process continues until num becomes 0.

Palindrome Check:
Checks if the original number is not equal to the reversed number.
If they are not equal, it means the number is not a palindrome, and the method immediately returns 0.

Returning 1 if all elements are palindromes:
If the for-each loop completes without returning 0 (meaning all elements are palindromes), the method returns 1.
