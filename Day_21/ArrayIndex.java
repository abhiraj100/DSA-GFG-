/*
Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
Output: 2
Explanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 1
Arr[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation: Here Arr[1] = 1 exists.
