Explanation :

isSubsequence Method: This method checks if a given string s3 is a subsequence of two strings s1 and s2.

Parameters:

s1: The first string.
s2: The second string.
s3: The string to check if it's a subsequence of s1 and s2.
i, j, k: Pointers for strings s1, s2, and s3, respectively.
dp: A 2D array used for dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
Algorithm:

It checks if the current position (i, j) has already been computed, if yes, it returns the result from the dp array.
If i, j, and k reach the end of strings s1, s2, and s3 respectively, then it means s3 is a subsequence of both s1 and s2, so it returns 1.
Otherwise, it recursively checks if the current character of s1 or s2 matches the current character of s3, and if so, it moves forward in s1, s2, and s3.
It stores the result in the dp array and returns it.
isInterLeave Method: This method is the entry point to check if the string c is an interleaving of strings a and b.

Parameters:

a: The first string.
b: The second string.
c: The string to check if it's an interleaving of a and b.
Algorithm:

It first checks if the length of c matches the sum of lengths of a and b. If not, it returns false because c cannot be an interleaving in this case.
It initializes a 2D array dp for dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
It calls the isSubsequence method with appropriate parameters and returns true if the result is 1, indicating that c is an interleaving of a and b, otherwise it returns false.
