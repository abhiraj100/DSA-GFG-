Initialization:
Creates a new ArrayList of integers to store the pattern.

Special Case Check:
Checks if N is zero or negative. If true, adds N to the list and returns it.
This handles the case where N is not a positive integer.

Pattern Generation:
Adds the initial value N to the list at index 0.
Uses a do-while loop to subtract 5 from the previous element and add the result to the list until the last added element becomes non-positive.
The loop index i is incremented after each iteration.

Pattern Completion:
Uses a second do-while loop to add 5 to the previous element and add the result to the list until the last added element becomes greater than or equal to N.
The loop index i is incremented after each iteration.

Return Result:
Returns the final list containing the generated pattern.
