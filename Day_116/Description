Explanation :

genIp(String s) method:

This method takes a string s as input and returns an ArrayList<String> containing generated IP addresses.
It checks if the length of the input string is greater than 12 characters. If so, it returns an empty ArrayList.
Otherwise, it calls the helpgenIp method to generate IP addresses and returns the result.

helpgenIp(int i, int count, String s) method:

This method is a recursive helper function to generate IP addresses.
It takes three parameters: i (index), count (segment count), and s (the input string).
It checks if count (the number of segments) exceeds 2. If so, it checks if the string is a valid IP address using the isValid method.
If the string is valid, it adds it to the list and returns. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.
It then iterates through the string, splitting it into two parts (first and second) and adding a period between them to form a new string aux. It then recursively calls itself with the incremented index and segment count.
Finally, it returns the accumulated list.

isValid(String s) method:

This method checks if a given string s represents a valid IP address.
It first checks if the string ends with a period, which would be invalid. If so, it returns false.
It then splits the string using the period as a delimiter and stores the segments in an array split.
It checks if the number of segments is not equal to 4, which would make it invalid.
It then iterates through each segment:
It checks if the segment is empty, starts with '0' followed by digits, or contains only zeros. These conditions would make the segment invalid.
It checks if each character in the segment is a digit between '0' and '9'.
It converts the segment into an integer using the con method and checks if it lies between 0 and 255.
If all conditions are met, it sets ans to true.
Finally, it returns the value of ans, indicating whether the entire IP address is valid.

con(String a) method:

This method converts a string representing a number into an integer.
It iterates through each character in the string, converting it to an integer and accumulating it to form the final result.
