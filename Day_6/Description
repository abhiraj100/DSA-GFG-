The shortestCommonSupersequence function uses dynamic programming to calculate the length of the shortest common supersequence.

It creates a 2D array scs where scs[i][j] represents the length of the shortest common supersequence of the first i characters of string X and the first j characters of string Y.

The function iterates through the strings and fills in the scs array based on the following logic:

If either of the strings is empty, the length of the supersequence is the length of the other string.
If the last characters of both strings match, reduce the problem to the rest of the strings.
If the last characters are different, choose the minimum of two possibilities (include the last character of X or Y) and continue with the rest of the strings.
The final result is stored in scs[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of strings X and Y respectively.

The function returns the length of the shortest common supersequence.
