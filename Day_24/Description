Class Definition:
The class is named Compute.

Method Signature:
Declares a method named rotate.
Takes two parameters: an array of integers (arr) and an integer representing the length of the array (n). The length (n) is not used within the method.

Variable Declaration:
Declares an integer variable x and assigns it the value of the last element in the array arr.

Right Rotation Loop:
Initiates a for loop that iterates over the elements of the array from the last element to the second element.
In each iteration, it shifts the value from the previous position to the current position.

Setting First Element:
After the loop completes, it sets the first element of the array (arr[0]) to the initially stored value x, which was the original last element.
