Initialization:

Three pointers are used: smaller, between, and larger.
smaller: Points to the next position where an element less than a should be placed.
between: Iterates through the array.
larger: Points to the next position where an element greater than b should be placed.

Partitioning:

The while loop continues until the between pointer crosses the larger pointer.
Three cases are considered inside the loop:
If the element at between is less than a, swap it with the element at smaller, and move both pointers.
If the element at between is between a and b (inclusive), move only the between pointer.
If the element at between is greater than b, swap it with the element at larger and move the larger pointer.

Final Result:

After the loop, the array is partitioned into three parts as described above.

Helper Method (swap):

The swap method is used to swap two elements in the array.
