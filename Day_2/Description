It iterates through each column of the matrix.
For each column, it counts the number of zeros in that column by iterating through each row.
It compares the current count of zeros with the maximum count of zeros encountered so far.
If the current count is greater than the maximum count, it updates the answer to the current column index.
Finally, it returns the index of the column with the maximum number of zeros.
