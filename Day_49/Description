Explanation:

The stockBuySell method iterates through the array of stock prices.
It identifies potential buying days and updates the buyIndex.
It also tracks potential selling days and updates the sellIndex.
If it reaches the last day, it adds the buying and selling days to the list.
If the price decreases, it adds the buying and selling days to the list and resets the buyIndex.
The addToList method adds the buying and selling days to the list if there is an ongoing buying process.
