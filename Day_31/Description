Class Declaration:

The class is named Compute.

Method Declaration:

The class contains a static method named sortBySetBitCount.
The method takes two parameters: an array of Integers (arr) and an integer (n), but the variable n is not used in the method body.

Method Implementation:

The body of the method uses Arrays.sort to sort the array arr.
The sorting is done based on the number of set bits (number of '1' bits) in each element.
The sorting is done in descending order, meaning the elements with a higher number of set bits will come first.

Lambda Expression:

The sorting is performed using a lambda expression (i1, i2) -> { return Integer.bitCount(i2) - Integer.bitCount(i1); }.
The lambda expression takes two integers i1 and i2 as input parameters.
Integer.bitCount(x) returns the number of one-bits (set bits) in the binary representation of x.
The lambda expression compares the set bit count of i2 with that of i1 and returns the result.
If the set bit count of i2 is greater than that of i1, it returns a negative value, indicating that i2 should come before i1 in the sorted array.
