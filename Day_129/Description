Explanation :

Class Definition:
This line declares a class named Solution. Inside this class, there's a method named isPalindrome.

Method Definition:
This line defines the method isPalindrome, which takes a string S as input and returns an integer. The integer return type suggests that the method likely returns 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 if it is not.

Variable Initialization:
str is a StringBuilder object used to store the reversed string.
s1 is a Stack of characters used to iterate through the characters of the input string S.

Character Pushing into Stack:
This loop iterates through each character of the input string S and pushes them onto the stack s1. This effectively reverses the order of characters in the string.

Reversing the String:
This loop pops characters from the stack s1 and appends them to the StringBuilder object str, effectively reversing the string.

Palindrome Check:
After the reversal, the code checks if the reversed string (str) is equal to the original string (S). If they are equal, it returns 1, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns 0, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

Closing Braces:
The method definition and class definition are closed with closing braces }.
