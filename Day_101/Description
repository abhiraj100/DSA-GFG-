Explanation :

The findLongestConseqSubseq method takes an array arr[] and its size N as input and returns the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers within the array.

It initializes fini to 1, assuming that the minimum length of a subsequence is 1.

It initializes count to 1, which represents the length of the current consecutive sequence.

It sorts the input array arr[] in non-decreasing order using Arrays.sort(arr).

It then iterates through the sorted array starting from the second element.

Inside the loop:

If the current element is equal to the previous element, it means there are duplicates, so it skips to the next iteration.
If the current element is consecutive to the previous element, it increments the count.
If the current element is not consecutive to the previous element, it resets the count to 1.
It updates the fini with the maximum value of fini and count.
Finally, it returns the fini, which represents the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers in the array.
