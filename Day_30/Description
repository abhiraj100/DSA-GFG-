Sorting the Array:

The Arrays.sort(arr) method is used to sort the input array arr in ascending order. Sorting is a common technique to arrange elements in a specific order.

Calculating the Maximum Sum:

A variable ans is initialized to store the sum of the products of array elements and their indices.
The code then iterates through the sorted array. For each element, it calculates the product of the element and its index (arr[(int)i] * i) and adds it to the ans.
The result is then taken modulo 1000000007 to keep it within a specific range and prevent overflow.

Returning the Result:

The final result is obtained by returning (int) ans % 1000000007. The casting to int is performed to ensure that the result is of integer type.
