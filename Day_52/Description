Explanation:

Input Reading:
The code starts by reading the number of test cases t.
For each test case, it reads the size of the array n and the array elements arr.

Solution Class:
The Solution class contains the static method inversionCount that takes the array arr and its size N as parameters.
It initializes low and high to represent the range of the array and calls the recursive inv method.

Recursive Function (inv):
The inv function is a recursive function that implements a modified merge sort.
It calculates the number of inversions in the array by dividing it into two halves and recursively counting inversions in each half.
It also calls the countMerge function to count the inversions between the two halves.

Counting Merges (countMerge):
The countMerge function is responsible for counting the inversions between the two halves of the array during the merge step.
It uses additional arrays left and right to store the elements of the two halves.
The merging is done while counting the inversions, and the merged array is updated in-place.
