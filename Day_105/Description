Explanation :

The code defines a class named Solution.
Inside the class, there's a method named transfigure which takes two strings A and B as input and returns an integer.
The method converts the input strings A and B into character arrays a and b respectively using the toCharArray() method.
It initializes two integers i and j to the lengths of arrays a and b minus one respectively. These variables i and j will be used as pointers to traverse arrays a and b.
It checks if the lengths of both arrays a and b are equal. If they are not, it returns -1, indicating that it's not possible to transfigure A into B.
It initializes an integer variable sum to zero. This variable will be used to keep track of the difference between the ASCII values of characters in arrays a and b.
It iterates through the arrays a and b simultaneously, calculating the difference in ASCII values of corresponding characters and updating the sum variable accordingly.
After the loop, it checks if the sum is zero. If it's not zero, it means that the total ASCII values of characters in A are not equal to the total ASCII values of characters in B, indicating that it's not possible to transfigure A into B. In this case, it returns -1.
It initializes an integer variable Result to zero. This variable will be used to count the number of characters that need to be transfigured.
It enters a while loop where it compares characters from the end of arrays a and b. If the characters are equal, it decrements both i and j pointers. If they are not equal, it decrements only the i pointer and increments the Result variable.
After the loop, it checks if the value of Result is equal to the length of array a. If it's equal, it means that all characters in A need to be transfigured to match B, indicating that it's not possible to transfigure A into B. In this case, it returns -1.
Finally, it returns the value of the Result variable, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be transfigured to convert A into B.
