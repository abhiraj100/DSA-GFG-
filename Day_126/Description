Explanation :

The find_permutation method takes a string S as input and returns a list of strings containing all permutations of S. It initializes a HashSet named temp to store unique permutations and an ArrayList named ans to store the final sorted list of permutations.

It calls the permutation method to generate permutations recursively, passing an empty string "" as the current permutation p, the input string S, and the set temp.

Inside the permutation method:

If the input string up (unprocessed string) is empty, it means all characters from the original string have been used to form a permutation. In this case, the current permutation p is added to the set temp to ensure uniqueness, and the method returns.
Otherwise, it iterates through each character of the unprocessed string.
For each character c at index 0 of the unprocessed string, it recursively generates permutations by inserting c at different positions in the current permutation p.
It does this by splitting the current permutation p into two substrings f and s at index i, then concatenating f, c, and s together to form a new permutation. This process is repeated for all possible positions of c within p.
Finally, the find_permutation method adds all unique permutations from the set temp to the ans list, sorts the list lexicographically, and returns it.
