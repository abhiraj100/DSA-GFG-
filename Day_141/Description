Explanation :

The function maxSubstring takes a string S as input and returns an integer representing the maximum sum of a substring where '0's are counted as +1 and '1's are counted as -1.
It initializes two variables sum and ans to keep track of the current sum and the maximum sum found so far, respectively.
It iterates through each character of the input string S.
For each character, if it's '0', it increments the sum; otherwise, it decrements the sum.
If the sum becomes negative (indicating that the current substring has more '1's than '0's), it resets sum to 0.
It updates ans to be the maximum of ans and sum.
Finally, it returns -1 if ans is 0 (indicating no valid substrings were found) or returns ans otherwise (the maximum substring sum found).
