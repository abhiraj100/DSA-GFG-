Explanation

Class Declaration:
class Complete: Defines a class named Complete.

Method Declaration:
public static int search(int arr[], int n, int x, int k): This method takes four parameters:
arr: an array of integers.
n: the number of elements in the array.
x: the value to search for in the array.
k: a variable (not used in the provided code).

Method Implementation:
The method uses a simple for loop to iterate through the array.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (arr[i]) is equal to the value x.
If a match is found, it returns the index i where the match is found.
If no match is found after iterating through the entire array, it returns -1.

Return Values:
If the value x is found in the array, the method returns the index of its first occurrence.
If the value x is not found in the array, the method returns -1.

Note:
The parameter k is declared but not used within the method. It seems to be unnecessary for the current implementation.
