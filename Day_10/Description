treeInfo is a simple class that stores two Node references, head and tail.
The inOrder method is a recursive function that performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree and returns a treeInfo object containing information about the head and tail of the CDLL for the current subtree.

Inside the inOrder method:

A new node (newNode) is created for the current root data.
The newNode is connected to the previous tail in the left subtree and the next head in the right subtree.
The output head and tail for the current subtree are determined, considering cases where the left or right subtree is empty.
The treeInfo object for the current subtree is returned.
The bTreeToClist method calls the inOrder method and then connects the head's left to the tail and the tail's right to the head to form a circular doubly linked list.
