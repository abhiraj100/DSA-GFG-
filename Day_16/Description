insertToAVL Method:

This method recursively inserts a new node with the given data into the AVL tree.
If the current node is null, a new node is created with the given data.
If the data is less than the current node's data, the insertion is performed in the left subtree.
If the data is greater than the current node's data, the insertion is performed in the right subtree.
If the data is equal to the current node's data, no insertion is needed, and the current node is returned.
After insertion, the height of the current node is updated, and the balance factor (bf) is calculated.
Depending on the balance factor, rotations are performed to maintain the AVL tree property.
rightRotate Method:

This method performs a right rotation on the provided node (y) and returns the new root of the rotated subtree.
It updates the heights of the affected nodes after the rotation.
leftRotate Method:

This method performs a left rotation on the provided node (x) and returns the new root of the rotated subtree.
It updates the heights of the affected nodes after the rotation.
getBalance Method:

This method calculates and returns the balance factor of a given node. The balance factor is the difference in height between the left and right subtrees.
height Method:

This method returns the height of a given node. If the node is null, the height is considered 0.
