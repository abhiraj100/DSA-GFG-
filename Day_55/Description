Explanation :

The function max_of_subarrays takes an array arr, its length n, and the size of the subarrays k as input.

It initializes an empty ArrayList called list to store the maximum elements of each subarray.

The outer loop (for loop with variable i) iterates through each possible starting index of a subarray of size K. It goes up to n - k to ensure that the entire subarray of size K can be considered.

Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop (for loop with variable j) that iterates through the elements of the current subarray starting from index i+1 (as max is already initialized with arr[i]).

Within the inner loop, the code compares each element with the current maximum (max) and updates max if a larger element is found using Math.max.

After iterating through the inner loop, the maximum element of the current subarray is added to the list.

The function continues this process for all possible subarrays, and the final result is the list containing the maximum elements of each subarray.
