The isIdentical method takes two Node objects (root1 and root2) as parameters.

The first base case checks if both trees are empty (root1 == null && root2 == null). If true, the trees are identical, and the method returns true.

The second base case checks if one tree is empty while the other is not (root1 == null || root2 == null). If true, the trees are not identical, and the method returns false.

If none of the base cases is satisfied, it means both trees are non-empty. The method checks if the data at the current nodes (root1.data and root2.data) are equal.

If the data at the current nodes is equal, the method recursively calls itself for the left subtrees (isIdentical(root1.left, root2.left)) and the right subtrees (isIdentical(root1.right, root2.right)).

The method returns true only if the current nodes are equal, and both left and right subtrees are identical.
