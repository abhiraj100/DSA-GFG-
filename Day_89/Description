Explanation :

Method Signature:

The method search takes four parameters:
A[]: An array of integers (presumably a rotated sorted array).
l: The starting index of the search range.
h: The ending index of the search range.
key: The element to be searched in the array.

While Loop:

The function uses a while loop to iterate through the array within the specified range (l to h inclusive).
The condition l <= h ensures that the loop continues until the search range is valid.

Comparison and Movement:

Inside the loop, it checks if the element at index l is not equal to the key.
If key is not found at index l, it increments l to move to the next element in the array.
If key is found at index l, it immediately returns the index.

Return -1 if Not Found:

If the loop completes without finding the key in the specified range, it returns -1, indicating that the key is not present in the array within the given range.
