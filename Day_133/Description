Explanation :

Class Declaration:

The code defines a class named Solution.
Static Variables:

ans: This is a static String variable initialized outside of any method, presumably to store the result.
bigBoy Method:

This method is a recursive function that aims to find the maximum number by performing swaps.
Parameters:
res: Current string (representing the number) being evaluated.
counter: The remaining number of swaps allowed.
pos: Current position in the string where the next swap can start from.
Functionality:
If the current res is greater than ans, update ans to the current res. This is done to keep track of the maximum number found so far.
If the number of swaps left (counter) is greater than 0, proceed with the swap operations:
Iterate through the string starting from the pos.
For each character at index i, compare it with all subsequent characters (j) to find a character greater than i.
If such a character is found, perform the swap and recursively call bigBoy with the updated string, decreased counter, and pos incremented by 1.
swap Method:

This method takes a string str and two indices i and j and swaps the characters at those indices.
It utilizes StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation.
findMaximumNum Method:

This method is the entry point for finding the maximum number.
Parameters:
str: The input number as a string.
k: The maximum number of swaps allowed.
Functionality:
Initialize ans to the input str.
Call bigBoy with the input str, k, and starting position 0.
Return the maximum number found stored in ans.
