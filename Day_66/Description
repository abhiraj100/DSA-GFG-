Explanation :

Initialization:
Here, a HashSet hs is created to store unique characters in the input string str. The for loop iterates through the string and adds each character to the HashSet.

Sliding Window:

Sliding Window Logic:
The while loop runs as long as the window contains all unique characters (hm.size() == hs.size()) and j is within the bounds of the string.
Inside the loop, it updates the count of the character at position j and checks if the count becomes zero. If it does, it removes the character from the HashMap, updating the minimum length of the substring (ans).

Result:
The function returns the minimum length of the substring that contains all distinct characters.
