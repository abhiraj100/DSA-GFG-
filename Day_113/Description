Explanation :

longestPath() method:

This is the entry point of the solution.
It takes the following parameters:
mat: The matrix representing the grid.
n and m: The dimensions of the matrix.
xs and ys: Coordinates of the source point.
xd and yd: Coordinates of the destination point.
It initializes an array ans to store the answer and a boolean matrix visited to keep track of visited cells.
It calls the solve() method to find the longest path starting from the source (xs, ys).

solve() method:

This method is a recursive function that performs depth-first search (DFS) to explore possible paths from the source to the destination.
It takes the following parameters:
xs and ys: Current coordinates.
n and m: Dimensions of the matrix.
mat: The matrix representing the grid.
xd and yd: Coordinates of the destination.
visited: Boolean matrix to mark visited cells.
count: Length of the current path.
ans: Array to store the longest path found so far.

Base case:
If the current position (xs, ys) is the destination (xd, yd) and it's a safe cell to move to, update ans if the current path length is greater than the previous longest path.

Recursive cases:
Try moving down, left, right, and up from the current position if it's safe to move to that position.
Mark the current cell as visited before moving to the next cell and backtrack once the recursive call returns.

isSafe() method:

This method checks if the given coordinates (x, y) are within the bounds of the matrix, represent an open path, and have not been visited before.
