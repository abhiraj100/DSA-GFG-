Explanation :

numberOfStudent Function:

Calculates the number of students required to distribute the pages with a given capacity.
It iterates through the pages, keeping track of the current capacity assigned to a student.
If the current capacity exceeds the given capacity, it increments the student count and resets the current capacity.

findPages Function:

Initializes the start and end values for binary search.
If the number of students is more than the number of pages, it returns -1 as it's not possible to distribute the pages.
If the number of students needed for the maximum pages is less than or equal to the available students, it returns the maximum pages.
Uses binary search to find the minimum number of pages required to distribute among students.
The binary search is conducted within the range of the maximum and total sum of pages.
It checks the number of students needed for the current mid value and adjusts the search space accordingly.
The function returns the minimum number of pages required for distribution.
