Explanation :

The helper method is defined inside the class. It takes three parameters:

p: A string representing the current subsequence being formed.
up: A string representing the remaining portion of the input string that has not been included in the subsequence yet.
vowel: A HashSet containing vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Inside the helper method:

If the remaining string up is empty, it means we have explored all characters of the input string. In this case, if the current subsequence p is not empty and its first character is a vowel while its last character is not a vowel, it is added to the result set ans.
The method returns ans.
The allPossibleSubsequences method is a static method of the Solution class. It initializes a HashSet named vowel containing the vowels.

It calls the helper method with an empty initial subsequence "", the input string s, and the set of vowels vowel.

The helper method is called recursively:

At each step, it considers two possibilities:
Include the current character in the subsequence (p + ch), and move to the next character in up.
Exclude the current character from the subsequence (p remains unchanged), and move to the next character in up.
The results of both possibilities are combined and returned.
Finally, the method returns the result obtained from the helper method, which is a TreeSet containing all the subsequences that start and end with a vowel.
