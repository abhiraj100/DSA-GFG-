Explanation :

Initialize three pointers i, j, and l to 0. i and j represent the current positions in arr1 and arr2 respectively, and l keeps track of the count of elements processed.

Use a while loop to iterate until the kth element is found or one of the arrays is exhausted.

Compare elements at the current positions in arr1 and arr2.

If the element in arr1 is smaller, check if it's the kth element. If yes, return it. Otherwise, move to the next element in arr1 and increment the count l.

If the element in arr2 is smaller, check if it's the kth element. If yes, return it. Otherwise, move to the next element in arr2 and increment the count l.

If one of the arrays is exhausted, but the kth element is not reached, continue searching in the remaining part of the non-exhausted array.

Finally, if the kth element is not found in the merged arrays, return 0.
