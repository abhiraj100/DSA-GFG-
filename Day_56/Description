Explanation : 

Function Signature:
The function findPlatform takes three parameters:
arr: An array representing the arrival times of trains.
dep: An array representing the departure times of trains.
n: The number of trains.

Sorting Arrays:
The Arrays.sort method is used to sort both the arr (arrival times) and dep (departure times) arrays in ascending order. Sorting is essential for the algorithm to work correctly.

Initializing Variables:
max: Keeps track of the maximum number of platforms needed at any point.
count: Maintains the current number of platforms in use.
p: Index for iterating through the arrival times array (arr).
d: Index for iterating through the departure times array (dep).

Main Loop:
The main loop continues until either the arrival array (arr) or the departure array (dep) is fully processed.

Checking Arrival and Departure Times:
If the current arrival time is less than or equal to the current departure time, it means a train has arrived but not departed. In this case, we increment the count (number of platforms in use), move to the next arrival time (p++), and update the max if the current count is greater than the current max.
If the current arrival time is greater than the current departure time, it means a train has departed. In this case, we decrement the count (a platform is now available), and move to the next departure time (d++).

Result:
The function returns the maximum number of platforms required to handle the trains without any conflicts.
