Explanation :

Class Declaration:
This line declares a class named Solution.

Method Declaration:
This declares a method named FirstNonRepeating that takes a string A as input and returns a string.

StringBuilder Initialization:
This initializes a StringBuilder named result which will be used to build the resulting string.

LinkedHashMap Initialization:
This initializes a LinkedHashMap named map to keep track of characters and their counts. LinkedHashMap maintains the order of insertion.

Iterating through the Input String:
This loop iterates through each character of the input string A one by one.

Updating Character Counts:
This line updates the count of the current character in the map. If the character is not present in the map, it initializes the count to 1; otherwise, it increments the existing count by 1.

Appending the First Non-Repeating Character to Result:
This line appends the first non-repeating character found so far to the result string by calling the getFirstNonRepeating method.

Returning the Resulting String:
This returns the final result as a string.

getFirstNonRepeating Method:
This method iterates through the map and returns the first character with a count of 1 (indicating it's non-repeating). If no such character is found, it returns '#'. This method helps in finding the first non-repeating character encountered during the iteration through the input string.
