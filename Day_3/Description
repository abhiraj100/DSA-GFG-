It initializes an array 'result' with integers in increasing order from 1 to n, where n is the length of the pattern plus 1.
It processes the pattern, and whenever a 'D' is encountered, it reverses the corresponding subarray in the result array to make it decreasing.
Finally, it converts the result array to a string and returns the minimum number.
