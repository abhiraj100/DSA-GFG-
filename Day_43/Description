Explanation:

Class Declaration:
The code defines a class named Solution.

Method Declaration:
The class contains a method named findMinSum that takes three parameters:
A: an array of integers.
B: another array of integers.
N: an integer representing the size of the arrays.

Variable Declaration:
The method declares a variable sum of type long and initializes it to 0. This variable will be used to store the cumulative sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of arrays A and B.

Sorting Arrays:
The Arrays.sort(A) and Arrays.sort(B) statements sort the arrays A and B in ascending order.

Calculating Sum:
The code then enters a loop that iterates from i=0 to i<N-1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the absolute difference between the i-th elements of arrays A and B using Math.abs(A[i] - B[i]) and adds this value to the sum.

Returning Result:
Finally, the method returns the computed sum.
