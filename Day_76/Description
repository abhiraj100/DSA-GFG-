Explanation :

The method initializes some variables, including the maximum product (max), the maximum negative element (max_negative), and counters for negative elements (count_neg) and zero elements (count_zero).

It iterates over the array elements and updates the maximum product considering each element. It also keeps track of negative elements and the maximum negative element.

There are special cases handled:

If all elements are zeros, the maximum product is zero.
If there is only one negative element and the rest are zeros, the maximum product is zero.
If the count of negative elements is odd, it divides the maximum product by the maximum negative element.

Finally, it returns the maximum product as an integer.
