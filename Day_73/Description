Explanation : 

nextPermutation method:

Takes two parameters: N (the length of the array) and arr (an array of integers).
Initializes ind to -1, which will later be used to identify the position to swap.
Iterates through the array from right to left to find the first pair of adjacent elements where arr[i] < arr[i+1]. If found, it sets ind to i and breaks the loop.
Checks if ind is still -1 after the loop. If so, it means the array is in descending order, and the entire array needs to be reversed to get the smallest permutation.
If ind is not -1, it searches for the rightmost element greater than arr[ind] and swaps them. Then, it reverses the subarray from ind + 1 to the end.
Converts the array to a List and returns it.

reverseArray method:

Takes an array arr and two indices start and end.
Reverses the subarray from start to end using a two-pointer approach.

swapElements method:

Takes an array arr and two indices i and ind.
Swaps the elements at positions i and ind in the array.
