Explanation :

ArrayList<Integer> li = new ArrayList<>();: This line creates an ArrayList named li to store the elements of the matrix.

The nested loop:
This loop iterates through each element of the input matrix Mat and adds them to the ArrayList li.

Collections.sort(li);: This line sorts the elements in the ArrayList li in ascending order.

int[][] sortedMat = new int[N][N];: This line creates a new 2D array named sortedMat with the same dimensions as the input matrix to store the sorted elements.

The nested loop:
This loop iterates through each element of the sorted ArrayList li and assigns them to the corresponding position in the sortedMat array.

Finally, the method returns the sorted matrix sortedMat.
