The function isSubset takes two arrays a1 and a2 as well as their respective lengths n and m as input parameters.

It uses a HashMap called map to store the frequency of each element in array a1.

The first for loop iterates through each element in array a1 and updates the frequency in the map.

The second for loop iterates through each element in array a2.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current element in a2 is present in a1 (i.e., it checks if the frequency in map is not null and greater than 0).

If the element is not present or its frequency is 0, the function returns "No" indicating that a2 is not a subset of a1.

If the element is present, it decrements its frequency in the map.

If the function completes the second loop without returning "No," it means all elements in a2 are found in a1 with the required frequencies, and it returns "Yes."
