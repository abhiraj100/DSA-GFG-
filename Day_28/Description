HashMap Initialization:

The code initializes a HashMap named map to store the count of occurrences for each element in the array.

Calculate Minimum Required Count:

It calculates the minimum required count (val) for an element to be considered appearing more than n/k times.

Populating the HashMap:

The code iterates through the input array arr and uses a HashMap to count the occurrences of each unique element.

Counting Occurrences:

The code then iterates through the entries of the HashMap and counts the elements that appear more than n/k times.

Return the Result:

The final count is returned as the output of the countOccurence method.
