The areIsomorphic function checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, it immediately returns false as strings of different lengths cannot be isomorphic.

It uses a HashMap to keep track of the mapping between characters of str1 and str2.

It iterates through each character of the strings and checks the following:

If char1 is already in the map, it checks if the mapping is consistent with char2.
If char1 is not in the map, it checks if char2 is already mapped to another character. If yes, the strings are not isomorphic.
If both conditions are satisfied, it adds the mapping of char1 to char2 in the map.
If the loop completes without returning false, the strings are considered isomorphic, and the function returns true.

The main method demonstrates the usage of the areIsomorphic function by checking if the strings "egg" and "add" are isomorphic. The output is printed accordingly.
