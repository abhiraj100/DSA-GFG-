Explanation :

The function minSwaps takes an array of integers as input.

It creates a copy of the input array (temp) and sorts it. This sorted array will be used to determine the correct order.

A HashMap (map) is created to store the index of each element in the original array.

The function iterates through the array and checks if the current element is in the correct position. If not, it swaps the elements to move towards the correct order.

The number of swaps is counted, and the index of each element in the original array is updated in the HashMap.

The function returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array sorted.
