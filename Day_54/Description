Explanation :

Method Signature:
spirallyTraverse is a static method that takes three parameters:
matrix: a 2D array representing the matrix to be traversed.
r: an integer representing the number of rows in the matrix.
c: an integer representing the number of columns in the matrix.
The return type is an ArrayList<Integer> containing the elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Initialization:
ans is an ArrayList to store the result.
sr, lr, sc, and lc represent the starting and ending indices for rows and columns, initialized based on the matrix dimensions.
t is the total number of elements in the matrix.
count is used to keep track of the number of elements added to the result.

Spiral Traversal:
The while loop continues until all elements are added to the result.
Four for loops traverse the matrix in four directions (right, down, left, up), and elements are added to the ans ArrayList.
After each traversal, corresponding start or end indices are updated to shrink the traversal boundaries.

Result:
The ArrayList containing the spiral traversal elements is returned.
