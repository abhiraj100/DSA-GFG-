Explanation :

solve method:
It takes an array of integers arr and an integer n as input parameters.
It sorts the array arr in ascending order using Arrays.sort(arr).
Two StringBuilder objects, a and b, are initialized to store alternate elements from the sorted array.
The for loop iterates through the sorted array, appending elements to a if the index i is odd, and to b if the index i is even.
After the loop, it calls the sum method with the reversed a and b as arguments and stores the result in the variable sum.
Finally, it returns the computed sum.

sum method:
It takes two StringBuilder objects, a and b, as input parameters.
It determines the maximum length between a and b and stores it in the variable len.
It initializes variables for carrying, a temporary StringBuilder for the result (temp), and iterators i and j.
The while loop iterates through each digit position until there are no more digits in both a and b, and there is no carry left.
At each iteration, it extracts the digits from a and b at the current position (or assumes 0 if no digit is available), adds them along with the carry, updates the carry and appends the sum to the temp StringBuilder.
After the loop, it reverses the temp StringBuilder and removes leading zeros.
If the resulting string is all zeros, it returns "0"; otherwise, it returns the substring without leading zeros.
