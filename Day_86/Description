Explanation :

The wineSelling method processes an array of values (Arr) representing wine bottles, where positive values represent buying wine, and negative values represent selling wine.
The method uses two ArrayDeque instances (pos and neg) to maintain separate queues for positive and negative values.
The algorithm iterates through the array, and for each value, it performs the following steps:
If the value is positive, it adds a new pair to the positive queue (pos).
If the positive queue is not empty, it processes pairs of positive and negative values, updating the total work done and adjusting the queues accordingly.
If the value is negative, it adds a new pair to the negative queue (neg).
If the negative queue is not empty, it processes pairs of positive and negative values, updating the total work done and adjusting the queues accordingly.
The method returns the total work done.
