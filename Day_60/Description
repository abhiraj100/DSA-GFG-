Explanation :

Method Signature:
The method takes four parameters:

arr: The input array of integers.
l: The left index of the current subarray being considered.
r: The right index of the current subarray being considered.
k: The desired position of the element to find (1-based index).

Sorting the Array:
The array arr is sorted in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. Sorting the array makes it easier to find the kth smallest element.

Binary Search:
The code uses a binary search-like approach to efficiently find the kth smallest element in the sorted array.

Midpoint Calculation:
The midpoint mid of the current subarray is calculated using the formula (l + r) / 2. This prevents overflow issues when calculating the midpoint.

Comparison and Adjustment of Subarray Boundaries:
If mid is equal to k - 1, then the element at the mid index is the kth smallest element, and the method returns that element.
If mid is less than k - 1, it means that the kth smallest element lies in the right half of the current subarray. So, the left boundary l is adjusted to mid + 1.
If mid is greater than k - 1, it means that the kth smallest element lies in the left half of the current subarray. So, the right boundary r is adjusted to mid - 1.

Return Result:
The method returns the element at the l index, which corresponds to the kth smallest element in the original array.
