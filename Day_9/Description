The method initializes a StringBuilder named ans to store the result string. It starts with a string of '0' characters.

The variable k is decremented because the characters are assumed to be in the range [0, k-1].

A HashSet named visited is used to keep track of visited strings to ensure uniqueness.

The code then enters a loop that continues until all possible strings of length n with characters in the range [0, k-1] are visited.

In each iteration, the last (n-1) characters of the current result string (previous) are considered.

The code iterates from k down to 0 to find the next character. It creates a candidate string (currStr) by appending the new character to the previous substring.

If the candidate string is not already visited, it is added to the set of visited strings, and the new character is appended to the result string.

The loop continues until all possible strings are visited.

The final generated string is returned.
