Initialization:
The code initializes variables to keep track of the product of all non-zero elements (product), an array to store the result (arr), and counts of zeros (zeroCount) and the index of the last zero encountered (zeroIndex).

Iterating through the Array:
The code iterates through the input array (nums), calculating the product of all non-zero elements and keeping track of the number and index of zeros.

Handling Multiple Zeros:
If there are more than one zero in the array (zeroCount > 1), the method returns an array of zeros as the result.

Calculating the Final Result:
If there are no zeros, the method calculates the result by dividing the product by the element at each index.
If there is exactly one zero, the product is set to the element at the zero index.

Returning the Result:
The resulting array (arr) is returned as the final output.
