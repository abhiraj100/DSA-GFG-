Explanation : 

Counting the elements:

f is the count of elements in the array that are less than or equal to k.
nf is the count of elements among the first f elements that are greater than k.

Sliding Window Technique:

The code uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of swaps.
The window initially covers the first f elements.
The loop iterates until the right pointer (r) reaches the end of the array.
The result (res) is updated with the minimum of the current result and nf.
The window moves one step to the right, and nf is updated based on the new elements included/excluded in the window.

Result:

The final result is the minimum number of swaps required to bring all elements less than or equal to k to the beginning of the array.
