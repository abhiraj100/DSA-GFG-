Explanation :

Sorting Array A:
The first step is to sort the array A[] in ascending order. Sorting is crucial for efficiently searching for triplets, as it simplifies the process of finding the triplet sum.

Iterating Through Array:
The outer loop (for loop with index i) iterates through each element of the array.

Two Pointers Technique:
Inside the outer loop, two pointers (j and k) are initialized. These pointers represent two positions in the array, one starting from the next element after i (denoted by j), and the other starting from the end of the array (denoted by k).

Triplet Sum Check:
The code then enters a while loop that continues until j is less than k.
Within the loop, it checks if the sum of elements at indices i, j, and k is equal to the given target sum X.
If the sum is equal to X, it means a triplet has been found, and the function returns true.
If the sum is less than X, it increments j to explore larger values.
If the sum is greater than X, it decrements k to explore smaller values.

Return False if No Triplet is Found:
If the while loop completes without finding a triplet, the outer loop continues to the next iteration.
If no triplet is found after iterating through all elements, the function returns false.
