Explanation

Function Signature:
The function takes a 2D array M representing the relationship matrix of people in a party, where M[i][j] is 1 if person i knows person j, and 0 otherwise. n is the number of people in the party.

Initialize Stack:
A stack pc is initialized with numbers from 0 to n-1, representing the indices of people in the party.

Elimination Loop:
In this loop, pairs of people are popped from the stack, and one of them is eliminated based on their relationship. If M[person1][person2] == 1, it means person1 knows person2, so person1 is not a celebrity, and person2 is pushed back onto the stack. If M[person1][person2] == 0, it means person1 does not know person2, so person2 is not a celebrity, and person1 is pushed back onto the stack.

Retrieve Candidate:
After the elimination loop, the remaining person in the stack is a potential candidate for being a celebrity.

Verification Loop:
The code then checks if the candidate is indeed a celebrity by verifying that everyone else knows the candidate (M[candidate][i] == 1) and the candidate knows no one (M[i][candidate] == 0). If these conditions are not met for any person i, the candidate is not a celebrity, and -1 is returned.

Return Result:
If the candidate passes the verification, the function returns the index of the celebrity; otherwise, it returns -1.
