Explanation of the code :

mergeHeaps Method:
This method takes two arrays (a and b) along with their lengths (n and m) and merges them into a new array result.
It copies the elements of arrays a and b into result.
Then, it builds a heap from the merged array using the heapify method.

heapify Method:
This method is responsible for maintaining the heap property of the array.
It takes an array arr, its size n, and an index i as input.
It identifies the largest element among the root, left child, and right child.
If the largest element is not the root, it swaps the root with the largest child and recursively calls heapify on the affected subtree.
