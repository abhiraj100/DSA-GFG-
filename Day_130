Explanation :

factorial(int N): This method calculates the factorial of a given integer N and returns the result as an ArrayList<Integer>. It initializes an ArrayList named a to store the digits of the factorial. It starts with adding 1 to the list, as the factorial of 0 or 1 is 1. Then, it iterates from 2 to N, calling the multiply method for each iteration to multiply the current value of a with the current number i. After the loop, it reverses the order of elements in the list (since the multiplication process generates the digits in reverse order) and returns the result.

multiply(ArrayList<Integer> a, int n): This method multiplies the given ArrayList a (which represents a number) by the integer n. It iterates through each digit of a, performing multiplication and carrying operations. Inside the loop, it computes the product of the ith digit of a and n, adds the carry (c) from the previous operation, updates the ith digit of a with the least significant digit of the result, and calculates the carry for the next iteration. After the loop, if there's any remaining carry, it adds the carry digits to the end of the list a. This method effectively performs multiplication of a large number represented by the ArrayList with a single digit n.
