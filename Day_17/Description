The method nthRowOfPascalTriangle takes an integer n as input and returns an ArrayList of Long integers representing the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.

It initializes an ArrayList pre to store the previous row of Pascal's Triangle.

A loop runs for each row up to the nth row (for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)).

Inside the loop, a new ArrayList current is initialized to store the current row.

Another loop runs for each element in the current row (for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++)).

Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the current element is the first or last in the row (if (j == i | j == 0)). If true, it adds 1 to the current row.

If the current element is not the first or last, it calculates the value by adding the corresponding elements from the previous row (pre.get(j) + pre.get(j - 1)) and takes the result modulo 1000000007 (mod).

The calculated value is added to the current row.

After constructing the current row, it becomes the new pre (previous) row for the next iteration.

The loop continues until the nth row is constructed.

Finally, the method returns the ArrayList representing the nth row of Pascal's Triangle (return pre).
