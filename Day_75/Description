Explanation :

The method takes three parameters:

A: an array of long integers.
N: the length of the array.
K: an integer representing the size of the sliding window.

Inside the method:

An ArrayList<Long> named cur is used to store the first negative integer in each window.
A Queue<Long> named q (implemented as a LinkedList) is used to maintain the negative integers within the sliding window.

The code then iterates over the first 'K' elements of array 'A' and enqueues negative values into the queue 'q'.

It uses a sliding window approach to process the remaining elements of the array.

At each step, it checks whether the queue 'q' is empty or not. If not, it adds the front element of the queue to the 'cur' ArrayList.
It then moves the sliding window by incrementing both the left (l) and right (r) pointers.
If the element at the left pointer 'l' matches the front element of the queue, it is dequeued.
If there are more elements in the array and the current element is negative, it is enqueued.

Finally, the 'cur' ArrayList is converted to a long array 'res', which is then returned.
