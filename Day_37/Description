Explanation:

Queues Initialization:

Two queues, pos and neg, are initialized using the LinkedList class. pos is meant to store positive integers, and neg is meant to store negative integers.

Separating Positive and Negative Integers:

A loop is used to iterate through the array arr[].
If the current element is non-negative, it is added to the pos queue. Otherwise, it is added to the neg queue.

Merging Alternately:

A while loop is used to iterate through the array arr[] again.
If the pos queue is not empty, a positive integer is polled from the queue and added to the array.
If the neg queue is not empty and there is space in the array, a negative integer is polled from the neg queue and added to the array.
This process continues until the array is filled with positive and negative integers alternatively.
