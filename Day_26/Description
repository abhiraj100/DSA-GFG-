Initialization (Constructor):

The class has three instance variables:
arr: An integer array to store the elements of the two stacks.
size: The maximum size of the array (assumed to be 100).
top1 and top2: Pointers to the tops of stack1 and stack2, respectively.
In the constructor (twoStacks), the array is initialized, and the top pointers are set to appropriate initial positions.

Push Operations (push1 and push2):

push1: Increments top1 and assigns the value x to the element at the updated position in the array, effectively pushing an element onto stack1.
push2: Decrements top2 and assigns the value x to the element at the updated position in the array, effectively pushing an element onto stack2.

Pop Operations (pop1 and pop2):

pop1: Checks if stack1 is empty (top1 == -1). If not, it returns the element at the top of stack1 and decrements top1. If stack1 is empty, it returns -1.
pop2: Checks if stack2 is empty (top2 == size). If not, it returns the element at the top of stack2 and increments top2. If stack2 is empty, it returns -1.
