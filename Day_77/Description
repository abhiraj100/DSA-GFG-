Explanation :

find method:

This method takes three parameters: an integer array arr, its size n, and the element to be searched x.
It initializes an ArrayList<Integer> named li to store the results.
Calls two binary search helper methods (binarysearchfirstoccr and binarysearchlastoccur) to find the first and last occurrences of the element x.
Adds the results to the li ArrayList and returns it.

binarysearchfirstoccr method:

This is a binary search implementation to find the first occurrence of the element x in the array.
It takes the array arr, the low and high indices, and the target element x as parameters.
The variable result is initialized to -1.
The method uses a while loop to perform binary search.
If the middle element is equal to x, it updates result and continues the search in the left half by updating the high pointer.
If the middle element is less than x, it searches in the right half by updating the low pointer.
If the middle element is greater than x, it searches in the left half by updating the high pointer.
The loop continues until the search space is exhausted, and the method returns the index of the first occurrence.

binarysearchlastoccur method:

Similar to binarysearchfirstoccr, this method finds the last occurrence of the element x in the array.
It takes the array arr, the low and high indices, and the target element x as parameters.
The variable result is initialized to -1.
The method uses a while loop to perform binary search.
If the middle element is equal to x, it updates result and continues the search in the right half by updating the low pointer.
If the middle element is greater than x, it searches in the left half by updating the high pointer.
If the middle element is less than x, it searches in the right half by updating the low pointer.
The loop continues until the search space is exhausted, and the method returns the index of the last occurrence.
