Explanation:

Arrays.sort(arr): 
The input array arr is sorted in ascending order using the Arrays.sort method. This is a prerequisite for the subsequent logic.

int b = 0; and int l = n - 1;: Two pointers b and l are initialized. b points to the beginning of the sorted array, and l points to the end of the sorted array.

long sum = 0;: A variable sum is initialized to keep track of the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements from the beginning and end of the sorted array.

The while (b <= l) loop: This loop iterates through the array until b is greater than l. In each iteration, the absolute difference between the elements at positions b and l is added to the sum. Then, the pointers b and l are updated by moving b one step forward and l one step backward.

return 2 * sum;: The final result is twice the calculated sum. The logic seems to be designed to find the maximum possible sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the array after sorting.
